## 4. QPSK_demod.grc

**Purpose**  
QPSK signal demodulation.

**Parameter Description**  
In addition to the common parameters, the following must be configured:

- excess_bw
- Samples per Symbol, SPS

**Usage Instructions**  
- Symbol synchronization is achieved through Symbol Sync, and carrier synchronization is achieved through Costas Loop.  
- The sample can directly demodulate a 250 kHz QPSK signal.  
- To demodulate other signals, fine-tune the parameters as needed.

## 5. QAM_demod.grc

**Purpose**  
QAM signal demodulation, currently supporting QAM16 and QAM64.

**Parameter Description**  
In addition to the common parameters, the following must be configured:  
- symbol_rate
- excess_bw
- Samples per Symbol, SPS
- Constellation Object (defines the modulation scheme)  

**Usage Instructions**  
- Symbol synchronization is achieved through Symbol Sync, and carrier synchronization is achieved through DDPLL. (This is a non-official demo mudule; users can replace it with improved versions.)
- The sample can directlty demodulate a 250 kHz QAM16 signal.
- To demodulate other signals, fine-tune the parameters as needed.

## 6. ADSB_rx.grc

**Purpose**  
Demodulate flight signals and plot flight paths on a web page.

**Parameter Description**  
Optimized parameters are provided and can be used directly. For better performance, parameters may be adjusted as needed.  

**Usage Instructions**  
- This sample depends on the open-source project [gr-adsb](https://github.com/mhostetter/gr-adsb). Ensure the project is installed before use, otherwise modules may be missing.  
- After configuring the gr-adsb project, if you want to view flight paths on the web page, please note:  
  - The gr-adsb `gr-adsb/web/static/index.html` uses `socket.io` v2.0.0 by default. On newer Ubuntu systems, upgrade to v4.6.1 to display flight paths correctly.  
- It is recommended to use an antenna with good gain performance in the 1090 MHz band.

## 7. DAB_receiver.grc

**Purpose**  
DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting) signal demodulation.

**Parameter Description**  
Optimized parameters are provided and can be used directly.  

**Usage Instructions**  
- This sample depends on the open-source project [gr-dab](https://github.com/andrmuel/gr-dab). Ensure the project is installed before use, otherwise modules may be missing.
- After setting up the required dependencies, configure an appropriate center frequency to perform DAB signal demodulation.

## 8. WLAN_demod.grc

**Purpose**  
WLAN signal demodulation in the air

**Parameter Description**  
Optimized parameters are provided and can be used directly.  

**Usage Instructions**  
- This sample depends on the open-source project [gr-ieee802-11](https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11), **maint-3.10** branch.
  Before using this example, please install the project and its dependencies according to the **gr-ieee802-11** README to avoid missing modules.

- When running on **Ubuntu system**, it is necessary to adjust the **maximum shared memory of the system**. 
  This is because the **Transmitter** block in **gr-ieee802-11** uses the **Tagged Stream** mechanism, which buffers the entire frame in memory before processing. 
  Since the dafault shared memory size in Ubuntu is small, this may lead to insufficient buffer space.
  To fix this, execute the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=2147483648
  ```

- After completing the above configuration, you can run this sample normally to perform WLAN signal acquisition and demodulation.
